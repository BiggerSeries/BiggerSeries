# BiggerSeries
The BiggerSeries is a series of 1 mod and 1 library mod (yes I want to do more) with one main goal with its machines, bigger than everything else.

## BiggerReactors
Bigger Reactors has moved forward on the Big Reactors roadmap as of version 0.5.0, and brings with it some significant changes

For the most up-to-date information, refer to the wiki at [https://biggerseries.net](https://biggerseries.net)

BiggerReactors is the official continuation of [Big Reactors](https://github.com/erogenousbeef-zz/BigReactors) by Erogenous Beef.

Downloads can be found in the GitHub releases tab and on CurseForge [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biggerreactors)

## You need other mods to use it
Much like Big Reactors before it, BiggerReactors is a power generation mod *only.* You will need another mod to transport or use the power.
Don't expect to be doing much with BiggerReactors by itself.
 
 
## Phosphophyllite
Phosphophyllite is my BeefCore, it's the library mod that has my multiblock API among other things in it.

Nothing much interesting here unless you are a mod dev, in which case, read the Readme in the Phosphophyllite directory, if it exists, may not yet.

Oh, right, downloads, again on GitGub releases tab or CurseForge [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphophyllite).

#### Note on old BigReactors bugs
Bugs from BigReactors are *probably* no longer valid, if you think it might be, verify that the bug still exists with BiggerReactors before reporting it.
This being a full rewrite it shares almost no code with BigReactors and as a result will have its own suite of bugs.

## Licence
I am personally *not* a fan of closed source mods, so, its not closed source. BiggerReactors is under the LGPL v2.1.

As a TLDR, this means that you are free to
 - Use it in a modpack (please do)
 - PR bug fixes and changes in (*please do*)
 - Redistribute it (please dont)
 - Take the source code and make it your own (if im not updating it, by all means)
 - Use it as a library for your mod regardless of your license

However, you cannot
 - Take your changed version closed source

Just make sure to read LICENSE.txt for more details
